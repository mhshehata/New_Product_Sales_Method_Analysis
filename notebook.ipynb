Also, non-standard way of writing (\"email\") will be fixed to \"Email\". Cleaning is needed.\n- customer_id: no missing data; no duplicates; no cleaning needed.\n- nb_sold: no missing data; no cleaning needed.\n- revenue: 1074 values are missing. We will fix it using the appropriate method.\n- years_as_customer: no missing data; two values were higher than 40, which made no sense since the company was founded 40 years ago. We will replace these values with the max number possible.\n- nb_site_visits: no missing data; no cleaning needed.\n- state: no missing data; all 50 US unique states exist; no cleaning needed.\n\n\n## Data Cleaning\n\n- sales_method column: fixing typos and standardize the of writing the three methods as \"Email, Call, and Email + Call\".\n- revenue column: checking the percentage of the missing values; found that it is higher than 5%; filled in the missing values with the 'Imputating with Sub-Group' method using the median of the revenue for each sales_method sub-group.\n- years_as_customer column: replaced the unreasonable values with the max value of 40 years.\n\n\nAfter data validation, cleaning and re-validation, the dataset contains **15000 rows and 8 columns** without missing values.\n","metadata":{},"id":"c22f7f5b-2a69-4515-8b29-7b0e94829f11","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Data Analysis","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"22c07b2f-8047-46a2-861e-8f4cff76cde6"},{"source":"## How many customers were there for each approach?\n\nThe number of customers approached through **Email** is the largest of about 7500 customers, followed by the **Call** method with almost 5000 customers, then comes the **Email+Call** method with around 2500 customers.\n\n\n![Number of Customers per each Sales Method](sm_vs_cus.png)","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0774991e-e1aa-4cee-b7c3-5369225691d1"},{"source":"## What does the spread of the revenue look like overall? And for each method?\n\nThe histogram highlights the superior performance of the _Email_ sales method in terms of both revenue and frequency of higher-value sales.\nThe _Email + Call_ method shows a more balanced performance, while the _Call_ method lags behind in both aspects.\n\nHowever, focusing on the revenue aspect only, the _Email + Call_ customers is the highest revenue - distributed from 130 up to approximately 300. The revenue from the _Email_ customers came second, then comes in third rank the revenue range from the _Call_ customers.\n\n\n![Overall revenue spread and per method](revenue_spread.png)","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"90e581d1-8613-445c-9a8f-a8c91c563949"},{"source":"## Was there any difference in revenue over time for each of the methods?\n\nThe histogram below presents the distribution of revenue across different weeks.\n\nKey Observations:\n- Shape: The distribution is skewed to the right, indicating that most weeks have lower revenue, with a few weeks generating significantly higher revenue.\n- Center: The approximate center of the data (median) appears to be between 50 and 100 on the revenue axis.\n- Spread: The data is spread across a wide range of revenue values, with a long tail towards higher revenue amounts.\n- Overall: The histogram suggests that revenue fluctuates significantly from week to week, with a tendency towards lower revenue and occasional spikes of high earnings.\n\n![Revenue per week over time](revenue_week.png)\n\nTo further investigate the previous graph, we plotted the total revenue per week, and we found out that our sales rocketed in the first week with the highest revenue. However, sales started to gradually fall down for two week. By the fourth week, sales started to increase again, however this did not last long since it declined again in the sixth week.\nThis fluctauations need to be further investigated in order to find out the cause(s) and act accordingly. \n\n![Total Revenue per week per sales method](total_revenue_week.png)\n\n\nAdditionally, the average revenue per week was analyzed, as shown below, for each of the three sales methods used. \n\nThe analysis shows that the _Email + Call_ method consistently generates the highest average weekly revenue and continues to grow at a steady pace. The _Email_ method yields moderate, stable revenue growth, positioning it in the middle of the pack. The _Call_ method lags behind with the lowest average revenue and the slowest growth rate.\n\n![Average Revenue per week per sales method](avg_revenue_week.png)\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"7c1d0d9d-9147-417f-b18f-d174deaee300"},{"source":"## Further Analysis\n\n### Geographic Analysis\nWe wanted to analyze the revenue and number of customers in each state in order to prioritize our strategies and marketing campaigns in the highest performing states.\n\n![Revenue per state](revenue_state.png)\n\n\n\n![Number of customers per state](cust_state.png)\n\nAs shown, we plotted the top 10 states in terms of revenue and number of customers.
